                          <p>The Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA) began operating on 1 April 2003 with the merging of Singapore Immigration & Registration (SIR) and the checkpoint operations of the Customs & Excise Department (CED).</p>
                          <p>To meet emerging security challenges, about 1,000 CED staff members joined those from SIR to form ICA. The remaining 400 or so CED staff members merged with two units of International Enterprise Singapore to form Singapore Customs, the focus of which was customs and trade enforcement matters. This new agency was created to streamline trade processes to benefit the trading community and improve Singapore’s efficiency as a global trading hub.</p>

                                <p>The Customs & Excise Department (CED) is one of the oldest tax-collecting organisations and border protection agencies in Singapore, having started operation as the Government Monopolies Department in 1910. It has undergone numerous changes in its 90-year history.</p>
                                <p>The first duties CED imposed were on hard liquors and opium. Over the years, the range of dutiable goods expanded to include motor vehicles, liquor, tobacco products and petroleum. Aside from collecting revenue, CED worked closely with other government departments, such as the Central Narcotics Bureau, to safeguard Singapore’s welfare and security. The introduction of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) on 1 April 1994 further broadened CED’s job scope.</p>
                                <p>CED introduced a dual-channel traveller clearance system at Changi Airport in 1991 to simplify the passenger clearance process and save travellers time. The Red and Green Channels system of clearing incoming travellers was subsequently extended to all entry checkpoints in Singapore.</p>

Navy blue was chosen to establish ICA as a member of the Home Team. The uniform came in different designs to suit the varied operating environments in which officers work. Airport officers wear suits complete with jackets and ties, while sea-going officers wear long-sleeve coastal uniforms to protect them against the variable nature of weather.

                                      <p>One of our first checkpoints was Seletar Airport, which was completed in 1929 and served as a major link to remote regional areas.</p>
                                      <p>In 1937, Kallang Airport was opened to cater to the rising number of air travellers. As the popularity of air travel increased, passenger arrivals soon outstripped its capacity and Paya Lebar Airport was opened in 1955 to cope with the demand.</p>
                                      <p>After independence, all persons entering Singapore by road or by rail were checked at the Woodlands Checkpoint and Keppel Road Railway Station.</p>
