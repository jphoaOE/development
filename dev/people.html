                                  <p>I have been in service for more than 13 years and spent most of my years
          working in the Intelligence Division.
          I was posted to Woodlands Command
          as an Assistant Duty Officer after
          I completed my full-time sponsored
          studies at SIM-RMIT in June 2013. I
          was able to join the Senior Officer
          (SO) scheme and thereafter, I was
          scheduled to attend the SO induction
          course as a trainee.</p>

          <p>When my then Director (Intelligence)
          and Head (Data Analysis Unit) knew
          that I was shortlisted for studies
          sponsorship, they gave their full
          support and encouraged me to
          grab the opportunity. Following my
          interview for the transfer of scheme,
          they readily assisted me with the
          documentation that was required
          to secure the sponsorship. My
          bosses as well as colleagues kept
          me abreast with ICA’s developments
          throughout my course of studies. Most
          importantly, my family members
          were always there to support and
          encourage me throughout my
          course of studies, especially during
          assignments and exams periods.</p>

          <p>The last time I was involved in
          full-time studies was more than
          10 years ago. As such, it took me
          a while before I could adapt to school
          life and handle assignments and
          exams. It was also a challenge for
          me to interact and work with my
          fellow course mates who were much
          younger than me. It was challenging
          for me, especially during the exam
          period. I am glad that I have a
          supportive family and a sensible
          4-year-old daughter.</p>

          <p>By taking up full-time studies, it
          dawned upon me that I would have
          to exercise self-discipline and stay
          motivated in order to excel. Personally,
          I think that it is important to choose
          a course of study that one has interest
          in so that the whole process is
          enjoyable and one would be driven
          to do well. I decided to take up a
          Degree in Business Management as
          I always had interest in the subject.
          Having background and prior
          knowledge in the subjects, such
          as financial accounting, was also a
          bonus. No doubt it was hard, but
          I was glad that I took up this path.</p>

          <p>I appreciate the many opportunities
          for growth and development in
          ICA and I hope other officers can
          continue to do their best and work
          hard in their career in ICA</p>

                                    <p>I joined ICA on 8 January 2007. I am
            blessed to have the opportunity to
            learn and grow with an organisation
            like ICA. My first posting was
            to Woodlands Command and
            subsequently to Airport Command
            where I am currently. A key constant
            at work is the need for a human
            touch when clearing passengers. </p>

            <p>Early 2014, I helped an arriving
            autistic male Singaporean who had
            strayed to the wrong terminal.
            I managed to contact his anxious
            father to inform him of his son’s
            whereabouts before guiding the
            son back to the right terminal
            and helping him with immigration
            clearance. Thereafter, I assisted to
            collect his checked-in luggage before
            reuniting him with his father. </p>

            <p>Upon seeing his son, the father started
            berating me, saying that he had
            already engaged a wheelchair service
            to prevent his son from getting lost. I
            remained calm as I understood that
            the father was worried about the
            well-being of his son. I attempted
            to calm him by explaining that my
            help to his son arose from the ICA
            Departmental Values of Integrity,
            Commitment and Accountability
            ingrained in me. I also informed him
            that I was unaware of the wheelchair
            facilitation. The father finally realised
            my honest intent and thanked me
            for my efforts. From this episode,
            I would like to share with all
            officers to make use of the empathy
            that exists in all of us and we should
            all strive to deliver excellent service
            without compromising security, no
            matter how trying the circumstances
            may be. </p>
